    <h3>juinor software Engineer</h3>
    <p> I am currently studying at BYUI in Idaho, I'm trying to get my degree in Software Engineering. This is my first semester at BYUI,
        and so far I'm liking class alot, I find could to be very fun for me, I like creating things in code and seeing it work, and then seeing it
        do what I wanted it to do.
