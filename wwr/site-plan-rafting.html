    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose here is to help those who haven't experienced White Water Rafting
        to have a ton of fun, and to explain how the rafts are created and how much 
        power they have. This informtaion is essential to learn how to be safe and 
        have tons of fun, while going down the rafts.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This is a type of trip that can be very dangerous, so we recomend that only those,
      who have experience or want to risk there lives should go. It can be the most 
      rewarding once you've completed your first trip. If you are more experienced you can
      rent a rafting boat and go by yourself or your own group, or if you are'nt experienced you can hire a 
      guide to take you on one, and they will be albe to guild you safely down the rafts.
      Also another option is you can hire a guide and pay more for them to take you on a 
      crazy advanture to the best rafts. This experience should be for people ages 14yr - 55yr,
      and as for the cost of the adventures, it is 150$ for the basic trip. 200$ for the more 
      advance advanture's, and 185$ for the raft boat(doesnt include that guild).
