    <h1>
        This is a mustang GT 500
    </h1>
    <p> one thing that is cool about a mustnag GT 500 is that its really cool looking and can go 0-60mph in just 1.8 second.
        wow isnt that really fast for a car that just cost over 100,000$, rather than buying a car that 1,000,000$ just buy, 
        a mustang GT 500 and save 900,000$ dollers.
    </p>
    <p> you sould also look into the other mustangs as well, such as the GT 350 and the march 1 and the cyotie as well.</p>
